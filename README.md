# Multitenant SaaS Infrastructure for ASP.NET Core

## Overview

This open-source project is designed to help early-stage SaaS startups implement a robust, secure, and scalable multitenant architecture using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core. By leveraging the built-in Identity Provider and implementing multitenancy with a single database, this project provides a foundational structure that helps developers on startup teams understand and implement best practices for tenant isolation.

## Why This Project Exists

Early-stage SaaS startups often face challenges in correctly implementing multitenancy, leading to increased liability and potential security risks. This project aims to:

- Provide a standardized multitenant infrastructure using ASP.NET Core MVC and EF Core.
- Help development teams understand how multitenant SaaS applications should be structured.
- Centralize key functionality to reduce the risk of privacy violations and data leakage between tenants.
- Lower legal and compliance risks for startups by enforcing strong data segregation policies.

## Risks of Improper Multitenancy Implementation

Many early-stage startups overlook the implications of improperly handling tenant data. If a startup allows customers to view data belonging to other customers, this could result in:

- **Violations of Privacy Policies**: Companies could breach their own privacy agreements by exposing customer data.
- **Legal Liabilities**: Customers may pursue legal action if their sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized users.
- **Loss of Trust**: Customers expect strict data segregation in SaaS applications, and failing to provide this can damage a startupâ€™s reputation.
- **Security Compliance Failures**: Many businesses require compliance with security standards such as SOC2, and improper tenant data handling can directly impact compliance status.

## SOC2 Compliance and Security Considerations

SOC2 compliance is a critical factor for SaaS businesses handling customer data. A security compliance consultant has highlighted the following concerns:

- **Data Segregation**: Multitenant SaaS applications must ensure that each tenant's data is isolated to prevent accidental exposure.
- **Access Control**: Proper access control mechanisms should be in place to ensure users can only access data they are authorized to view.
- **Auditability**: Logging and monitoring mechanisms should track access and modifications to tenant data to maintain accountability.
- **Compliance Readiness**: Many enterprise customers require SOC2-compliant vendors, and failing to meet this standard can limit market opportunities.

## Implementation Details

This project provides:

1. **ASP.NET Core MVC Infrastructure**
   - Based on the official Microsoft template for individual user accounts.
   - Uses the built-in Identity Provider for authentication and user management.

2. **Multitenant SaaS EF Core Infrastructure**
   - Supports multitenancy within a single database.
   - Filters all queries for tenant data using `.HasQueryFilter(x => x.TenantId == tenantId)` within `OnModelCreating` in `DbContext`.

3. **Tenant Management via Dependency Injection**
   - A `TenantService` with `ITenantGetter` and `ITenantSetter` interfaces.
   - An `IMiddleware` component extracts the `tenantId` from an authentication token claim and sets it in `TenantService`.
   
4. **Security Best Practices**
   - Enforces tenant data isolation to protect privacy and comply with security standards.
   - Implements claim-based authentication for tenant identification.
   - Centralized tenant resolution logic to reduce errors and enforce security policies.

## How to Use This Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/multitenant-saas-aspnetcore.git
   cd multitenant-saas-aspnetcore
   ```
2. **Configure Tenant Middleware**
   - Ensure the `TenantMiddleware` is registered in `Startup.cs`.
   - Inject `TenantService` into your `DbContext`.

3. **Run Migrations**
   ```sh
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Implement per-tenant database encryption strategies.
- Add support for multi-database tenancy.
- Introduce tenant-level logging and monitoring for compliance auditing.
- Enhance role-based access control (RBAC) per tenant.
